Like so many others, I just wanted a place to collect some projects I worked on. Maybe I'll add a blog, maybe I won't. I'm not sure yet.

If you like the design, check out the Repository on GitHub.

### Built With

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Running Locally


```sh-session
git clone https://github.com/mplumer/next-portfolio.git
cd next-portfolio
```


Create a `.env` file similar to [`.env.example`](https://github.com/mplumer/next-portfolio/blob/main/.env.example).

Then install dependencies and run the development server:
```sh-session
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```
