# Jumpstart Productions

## Description

This site was built for Jumpstart Productions. It was originally created in 2019, and is currently undergoing a redesign.

This site showcases my ability to develope a custom Wordpress theme and plugins utilizing tools such as tools such as Elementor, Gutenberg blocks, WP Bakery, ACF, TailwindCSS, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and React. 
Adobe Creative Suite was used to design and edit logos, photos, and videos.
Created wireframes, storyboards, and user flows with Figma.
Implemented Google Analytics and Tag Manager to create and track sales funnels and conversions.
