# Hot Homes

## Description

This site was built with Next JS, using React JS and GraphQL to generate and build static pages from a given dataset. 
Wordpress was set up as a headless CMS while using NextJS to generate a blazing-fast 
server-rendered React website from WordPress data, such as custom post types, pages, menus, media, advanced custom fields, 
(and more!) using GraphQL to query that data. 

This project showcases development of Next JS and WordPress locally, mapping Gutenberg blocks to React components, creating custom Gutenberg blocks, 
styling these components with Tailwind CSS and querying WordPress and Gutenberg data with GraphQL to automatically 
generate the static pages.

Deployed to Vercel with webhooks that re-build the static web pages every time content is updated in the WordPress backend.
